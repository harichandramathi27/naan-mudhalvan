Title: AI-Driven Energy Efficiency Optimization for EBPL – Phase 5: Project Demonstration, Feedback, and Documentation

Abstract:

The final phase of the "AI-Driven Energy Efficiency Optimization for EBPL" project focuses on presenting the final implementation of the energy efficiency optimization system, showcasing its real-world application, and ensuring a comprehensive understanding for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The core objective is to evaluate the performance of the developed dashboard, analyse user feedback for final refinements, and document the entire development lifecycle for future maintenance and scalability. The documentation details the step-by-step process, challenges, outcomes, and future opportunities, providing a roadmap for further enhancements and long-term system integration.

Project Demonstration
Overview:

The project demonstration is a pivotal part of Phase 5, allowing stakeholders to engage directly with the solution. It serves as a platform for showcasing how the developed system can efficiently identify anomalies in energy consumption patterns and provide actionable insights. This phase also helps in validating the system’s performance, usability, and robustness under real-world conditions.

Demonstration Details:

• Data Input and Preparation: The first step in the demonstration is allowing users to upload an energy usage dataset, typically in CSV format. This dataset might contain data such as energy usage readings over time, various environmental variables, and operational parameters from EBPL’s facilities. The system accepts a wide range of data formats, with a maximum file size limit of 200MB to ensure smooth processing. For example, a sample dataset (ebpl_energy_usage_sample.csv) containing 480 rows of energy usage data is used to illustrate the system's capabilities.

• User Interface (UI): The user-friendly interface allows stakeholders to drag and drop the file or use a traditional file explorer dialog for uploading their data. Once the file is uploaded, the system automatically preprocesses the data by validating it for accuracy and completeness.

• Anomaly Sensitivity (Contamination Rate): An essential feature of the anomaly detection process is the ability to adjust the "contamination rate." This rate dictates the proportion of data points that are expected to be outliers or anomalies. The contamination rate can range from 0.01 (indicating a very small expected proportion of anomalies) to 0.20 (indicating a more aggressive anomaly detection strategy). This feature allows users to fine-tune the sensitivity of the anomaly detection algorithm (Isolation Forest) to better suit different operational conditions and expectations. For instance, in highly stable environments, a lower contamination rate might be preferred to minimize false positives. Conversely, in dynamic or less predictable environments, a higher contamination rate might be acceptable to catch more anomalies.

• Summary Metrics: After processing the data, the dashboard generates key metrics to provide an overview of the model's performance. These metrics include:

• Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric helps evaluate the deviation between predicted and actual energy usage values. A lower MAE indicates more accurate predictions.

• R² Score: This statistical measure indicates how well the model fits the data, with a value closer to 1 suggesting better fit.

• Total Anomalies Detected: This number represents the total count of anomalies identified by the model, helping stakeholders assess the system's effectiveness in detecting irregularities in energy consumption.

• Visualization of Energy Usage Over Time with Anomalies: A crucial aspect of the dashboard is the time-series graph that visualizes the energy usage data over a specified period. Anomalies are marked on this graph, allowing users to clearly identify when unusual energy consumption occurred. This is particularly helpful for energy managers and analysts who may need to investigate further or take action based on detected anomalies.

• Annotated Data Output: The processed data with marked anomalies can be downloaded as a CSV file. This annotated data provides users with a detailed record of energy consumption, including both normal and anomalous data points, enabling deeper analysis and reporting.

Outcome:

Through the demonstration, stakeholders gain a comprehensive understanding of the system’s capabilities, performance, and usability. The feedback gathered during this session is crucial for identifying areas of improvement before the final report submission

Project Documentation

Outcome:

The detailed documentation provides EBPL with all the necessary information to maintain and enhance the system in the future, ensuring its sustainability.

Feedback and Final Adjustments
Overview:

The feedback and adjustment phase is crucial for ensuring that the system aligns with user expectations. The goal is to incorporate input from stakeholders to finalize the system before delivery, addressing any issues related to usability, functionality, or performance. Feedback is actively sought, analysed, and applied to improve the final product.

Steps:

• Feedback Sessions: The system is demonstrated to EBPL’s key stakeholders, including energy managers, IT staff, and project managers. These sessions focus on gathering opinions on various aspects:

• Usability: Evaluating how intuitive the interface is. Are the controls and data visualizations clear? Is the dashboard layout easy to navigate, and does it present information effectively?

• Functionality: Ensuring that all features work correctly, including uploading energy usage data, running anomaly detection, and displaying accurate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² scores. Users provide feedback on whether these features meet their needs.

• Performance: Testing the system’s responsiveness and processing capabilities under real-world conditions, such as uploading larger datasets. Stakeholders assess whether there are any noticeable delays or errors in data processing and anomaly detection.

• Adjustment Implementation: After collecting feedback, a series of refinements are made:

• UI/UX Refinements: Based on user suggestions, minor adjustments to the layout may be made, such as repositioning buttons for better accessibility, adjusting colors for better visual appeal, or adding tooltips and help sections for guidance. These changes are implemented to ensure that the system is both functional and user-friendly.

• Backend Optimization: Any issues related to data processing speed are addressed. For instance, if stakeholders notice delays when uploading larger datasets, the backend system is optimized to handle these more efficiently, possibly through code refactoring or improving database queries. The anomaly detection model is also fine-tuned for better speed without compromising accuracy.

Outcome:

After the feedback sessions and subsequent adjustments, the system is ready for final delivery. All identified issues are addressed, ensuring the system operates efficiently and meets user needs. The finalized product is then prepared for deployment, and any minor improvements are documented for future versions.
